# TSNE & Spectral Clustering from scratch
This project explores the application of spectral clustering methods and compares their performance to commonly used versions available in popular libraries. We implemented these algorithms from scratch and utilized T-SNE for visualization. Our experiments were conducted on the Mnist and Mnist fashion datasets.

In this study, we explored the use of spectral methods for clustering. The primary objective of this work was to implement these algorithms from scratch and compare their performance with commonly used versions available in popular libraries. To facilitate visualization, we first applied the T-SNE algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the data. We then utilized the resulting reduced dimensions to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors using spectral methods. These eigenpairs were subsequently used to perform clustering using the k-means algorithm. Our experiments were conducted on two different datasets: the Mnist dataset and the Mnist fashion dataset.
